# JavaFindPrimeNumbers
<!---[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/martip23/JavaBinarySearchTree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/martip23/JavaBinarySearchTree)
--->
A program to find the prime numbers up to a given value N. Uses Sieve of Eratosthenes

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
    Must install any java JDK
    Project ready for Eclipse IDE
    Any IDE should work, source code is in /src
    In Eclipse IDE import .project file

## Program Requirements
* Program should output prime numbers up to a given upper bound, integer N.
* Program should find prime numbers in a computationally efficient manner using Sieve fo Eratosthenes.
* Program should also be able to take a filename as command line parameter for inputs.
* Should either overwrite or create new file with output.
* Files should be archived **(zipped?)** into file named *PrimeNumbersPM*
* Must use try/catch blocks (especially for input).
* Archive file should contain
    |1.	UML class diagram for the program generated by the SDE plug-in|
    |2.	Commented source code (comments per each class and method)|
    |3.	API docs produced by javadoc|
    |4. An output file with program's results|

### Built With
* [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/ide/) - Eclipse Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
